title: How to find time in university to do everytask ?
---

## I've spoke to one of the older pupils and he told me :
He didn't take serious university in first & second semesters & it hurt him bad; because amount of lessons increased & he couldn't get successful.
He advised me to do not forget a lesson & have balance in your way; if you do this, you'll get time also for your hobbies or...
And at the end he told me do not search for 20 in university; and here is not school! :)
