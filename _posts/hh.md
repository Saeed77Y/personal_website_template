As I searched, at first this game will give you a work office that some employees working in it. These imployees need you to planning. If you do this right, you will get promoted  & your salary will raise.
But you must be better than before; because problems get harder & harder after passing levels. Then your work office gets bigger, number of employees also raises & your work agreement extendes for a year. For controlling better the work office, you must manage time good & make yourself faster; you can also use employees for getting assistants.
But if you don’t do your tasks good, robots will get place of employees.
